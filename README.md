# rpi-monitoring

Monitoring environmental data with [Raspberry Pi SenseHAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/).

The program sends temperature, air pressure and humidity to a hard-coded URL (on localhost) with a HTTP POST.

This is my first ever Python code, so have some understanding or suggest changes.
